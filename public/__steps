1.load data normally from products.json file to home page and show products on homepage as not using redux-thunk
2.solved errors for keys
3.go to react-redux site npm i react-redux redux
4.set up redux store for that set up a file structure
5.src-->redux-->store.js
6.src-->redux-->reducer-->productreducer.js[here goes business logic]
7.productReducer.js ----define initialState and productReducer function and export
8.now pass productReducer function in store.js
9.in store.js import {createStore } from 'redux';
10.create store and pass productReducer and export store
11.now we have to make available the store for the whole application using  Provider (wrapper) from react-redux
12.to check everything is working properly..make a test state in productReducer.js
13.to receive a state react-redux gives us a hook called useSelector with a callback function.
in homepage we tested it successfully.that means we implemented redux with our project successfully
-----------------------------------
14.now start writing business logic in productReducer
15.redux-->actionType--->actionTypes.js
16.now we have to dispatch action on ProductCard.js using useDispatch hook
17.using onclick event on button we can dispatch an object
18.redux-->actionCreators-->productActions.js(here wrote dispatch function and export)to make code cleaner
19.REDUX DEVTOOL INTEGRATION:install for chrome..integrate in application npm install --save @redux-devtools/extension
20.store.js--import { composeWithDevTools } from '@redux-devtools/extension';
21.show cart product in cart.js:using useSelector hook and mapping
22.coding remove from cart functionality.same way like add to cart(productReducer.js,actionTypes.js,productAction.js)making button on productCard.
23.show remove button only in cart page by useLocation
24.design remove button
.................
Implementing remove functionality perfectly:
25.setting quantity on case ADD_TO_CART:
a.spread action.payload,set quantity:1..now if u add a product besides other attribute it adds quantity :1
b.in productreducer function make selectedProduct to check if the product is already in cart or not..if(selectedProduct)then increase quantity and remove that product from oldcart
c.now make an UI for quantity including conditional rendering
d.at this point if we click remove button still removes all products not decreasing quantity.
e.to fix this behaviour write on case REMOVE_FROM_CART
if(selectedProduct.quantity >1)
selectedproduct er quantity komabo nahole mane quantity 1 hole id die cart theke remove korbo
f.product cart theke remove korle jehetu UI te cart er shesh render hoy ty cart e add korar shomoy id onushate sort kore nici .
